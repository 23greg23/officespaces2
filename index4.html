          <p>Slava Epstein, Distinguished Professor in the College of Science, has led groundbreaking research in microbiology through the development of the iChip. The device—which is only a couple of inches in size—isolates and grows small colonies of individual bacterial cells in their natural environment, permitting researchers to access the 99 percent of soil-based microorganisms that won’t grow in a lab. When he’s not hard at work, Epstein can often be found exploring some of the world’s many countries and cultures—including some of the least developed corners of the globe. Here are a few of the items he keeps in his office, many of which he’s collected from his travels.</p>

Students in Jackson’s “Social Movement Communication” course participated in the public art project. </p>

    <p class="item"> Among the pile of award-winning robots Padir and his colleagues have
      built, there’s an incongruity-a brightly colored Rock ’em Sock ’em
      Robots game. It sits on the corner of his desk, Padir says, because it
      brings back fond memories of former students and the robotics
      competitions (slightly more advanced than the toy’s red vs. blue setup)
      in which they’ve competed. </p>

    <p class="item"> Padir’s work also includes designing brain-controlled prosthetics,
      such as this hand, which could be used to handle dangerous or
      sensitive materials. Padir is working with the Department of Energy to
      develop ways to replace the need for human hands to handle nuclear
      material.<br/>
      <br/>
      "Obviously that’s pretty dangerous, so we’re looking into problems and
      situations where robots could do these tasks under human supervision,
      but while the humans are far away," he said. </p>

    <p class="item"> Amy’s current research involves studying how stories can inspire children to be more physically active. Specifically, she examines how the storyline of a video game can increase children’s physical activity while they’re playing. Last year she received a five-year grant from the National Institutes of Health to continue this research, in which she is using technologies such as the Kinect for Xbox One, wearable devices like the ActiGraph activity monitors (wGT3X-BT and GT9X Link), and a Seca 813 scale to measure children’s physical activity during active gaming.</p>

    <p class="item">Amy grew up in Beijing, and often played jianzi as a child. The game involves keeping a weighted shuttlecock up in the air by kicking it or using other parts of the body except for the hands. She bought this one the last time she visited the city, and noted that the game promotes physical activity in children—a theme that ties directly into her research.</p>
